You can create host install hooks inside this directory.

The first one is /etc/hostcreator/postunpack.sh which
is called after debootstrapping and mounting the initial
filesystem.

The second one is /etc/hostcreator/postconfig.sh which
is called after chrooted configuring the new vm.

Both hooks are called if existing with two additional
parameters:
1. The vm name
2. The mount point of the root filesystem of the vm.
3. The distribution name
